									<p> Greetings! As a leader in the data analytics field, I highly recommend utilizing dynamic filtering in your dashboards. By doing so, you can easily access the most pertinent information, enabling you to make informed decisions in a timely manner. As a result, dynamic filtering is a valuable tool for any professional looking to succeed in their role.</p>


									<p> One such tool that I have utilized for dynamic filtering is Tableau. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, Tableau has allowed me to showcase a multitude of insights. For instance, I was able to present the percentage of revenue generated by region, revenue per age group, revenue per month, and revenue per category and gender. By presenting these insights in a clear and concise manner, I was able to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions to drive their businesses forward.</p>


									<p> Having the ability to present insights in an effective manner is a key skill for any data professional to possess. By leveraging dynamic filtering and tools like Tableau, you can unlock a world of possibilities in terms of data visualization and analysis. I am committed to providing educational resources to help individuals develop these valuable skills, and I encourage you to explore the many benefits of dynamic filtering in your own data analysis efforts.

One such project was the creation of a dashboard that focused on trending analysis of the top 10 cryptocurrencies.</p>

									<p> Using Tableau, I was able to bring together complex data sets and create visually appealing and informative dashboards that highlighted key project highlights. Through my work on this project, I gained a deep understanding of the intricacies of the cryptocurrency market, including the key factors driving market trends and shifts.</p>

									<p> My data analysis skills allowed me to make sense of large amounts of data and identify patterns and trends that were not immediately apparent. This, coupled with my ability to create compelling data visualizations, made it easier for stakeholders to comprehend and act on the insights generated from the data.</p>

									<p> In summary, my work on this project provided me with valuable experience in data analysis, data comprehension, and data visualization, as well as a deep understanding of the cryptocurrency market.

										the case where the game ends in a draw, and includes a reset button to allow for multiple games to be played
